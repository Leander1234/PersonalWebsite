                Disney was originally founded on October 16, 1923, by brothers Walt and Roy O. Disney as the Disney
                Brothers Cartoon Studio; it also operated under the names The Walt Disney Studio and Walt Disney
                Productions before officially changing its name to The Walt Disney Company in 1986. The company
                established itself as a leader in the American animation industry before diversifying into live-action
                film production, television, and theme parks.

            <p>Mickey generally appears alongside his girlfriend Minnie Mouse, his pet dog Pluto, his friends Donald
                Duck and Goofy, and his nemesis Pete, among others. Though originally characterized as a cheeky lovable
                rogue, Mickey was rebranded over time as a nice guy, usually seen as an honest and bodacious hero. In
                2009, Disney began to rebrand the character again by putting less emphasis on his friendly, well-meaning
                persona and reintroducing the more adventurous and stubborn sides of his personality, beginning with the
                video game Epic Mickey.</p>

            <p>
                Looney Tunes (and Merrie Melodies) were initially produced by Leon Schlesinger and animators Hugh Harman and Rudolph Ising from 1930 to 1933. Schlesinger assumed full production from 1933 until selling his studio to Warner Bros. in 1944. The Looney Tunes name was inspired by Walt Disney's musical cartoon series, Silly Symphonies. The shorts initially showcased musical compositions whose rights were held by Warner's music publishing interests through the adventures of cartoon characters such as Bosko and, after losing him, Buddy. However, the animation studio gained a higher profile after it brought in directors Tex Avery and Chuck Jones and voice actor Mel Blanc in the mid-1930s. Porky Pig and Daffy Duck became the main stars of Looney Tunes at this time, while Merrie Melodies featured one-shot cartoons and minor recurring characters.

                Scooby-Doo is an American animated franchise comprising many animated television series produced from 1969 to the present, as well as their derivative media. Writers Joe Ruby and Ken Spears created the original series, Scooby-Doo, Where Are You!, for Hanna-Barbera Productions in 1969. This Saturday-morning cartoon series featured teenagers Fred Jones, Daphne Blake, Velma Dinkley, and Shaggy Rogers, and their talking Great Dane named Scooby-Doo, who solve mysteries involving supposedly supernatural creatures through a series of antics and missteps.
